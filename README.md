# NC-News API project

This is a project which was completed as part of the Northcoders' course back-end module. The purpose of the API is to create, read, update and delete information relating to a news website.

## Running the API on your local machine

To use this API on your computer, you must first fork it then clone it down by using the command `git clone https://github.com/petruS92/be-nc-news.git`.

Once you have copy of the folder on your computer, make sure to install the necessary dependancies needed in order for the API to run. A quick command to do this is `npm install`.
